Description:

401Change started out as the idea of Zach Spencer. The project was accepted to Lansing Givecamp 2011 (3/25/11-3/27/11). Here a small team made a lot of initial progress to the project.

The site is live at http://401change.org.

The general premise is that people should be able to share and discuss the needs they see in the world and the actions they do to improve these and make the world a better place. Much work remains to fully realize the goals of the project and essentially it is in a very very early alpha.


Contributing:

The project is written in Ruby using the Sinatra web framework, ActiveRecord, Haml for templating and RSpec/Cucumber/Capybara for testing.

Make sure you have Bundler installed:

	gem install bundler

Then from the root of the project install the required gems:

	bundler install

After this is done, to run the server locally we use shotgun so:

	gem install shotgun

Then finally to launch the site:

	shotgun
